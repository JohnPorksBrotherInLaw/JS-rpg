each scene is a different change in gameplay
Linear - frames read from first to last. play cannot move. plays like a visual novel. 
    Linear scenes end automatically when the last frame is read
NonLinear - frames are all generated at once and given to npcs. the player is free to roam around
    and interact with the npcs in anyorder he chooses, each triggering their own linear frame sequence
            NonLinear scenes must be ended using the endscene command called by some npc
some frames are commands and do things in the game. commands execute code then automatically jumps to next frame
    & - concat two commands in the same commandline separated by this character
    bkgclr - change backgroundcolor
    endscene - jumps to the next scene
